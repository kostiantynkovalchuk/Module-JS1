// When selling goods, most are subject to the 20% standard rate of VAT.
// You must add 20% to the price you charge for the goods.
// You can do this by multiplying the price you charge by 1.2.
// For example, if your business sells sports equipment for £50, you multiply £50 by 1.2 for a total VAT inclusive price of £60.

// Implement a function that calculates the new price with VAT (Value Added Tax) added on.

// Given a number,
// When I call this function with a number
// Then it returns the new price with VAT added on

function priceWithVAT(itemPrice) {
  const taxedPrice = itemPrice * 1.2;
  return `£${taxedPrice}`;
}
console.log(priceWithVAT(100));
