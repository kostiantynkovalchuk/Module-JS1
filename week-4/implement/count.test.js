// implement a function countChar that counts the number of times a character occurs in a string

// Given a string str and a single character char to search for,
// When the countChar function is called with these inputs,
// Then it should:

// Scenario: Multiple Occurrences
// Given the input string str,
// And a character char that may occur multiple times with overlaps within str (e.g., 'a' in 'aaaaa'),
// When the function is called with these inputs,
// Then it should correctly count consecutive occurrences of char (e.g., 'a' appears five times in 'aaaaa').

// Scenario: No Occurrences
// Given the input string str,
// And a character char that does not exist within the case-sensitive str,
// When the function is called with these inputs,
// Then it should return 0, indicating that no occurrences of the char were found in the case-sensitive str.

function countChar(str, char) {
  let index = 0;
  let maxCount = 0;
  let currentCount = 0;
  while (index < str.length) {
    if (str[index] === char) {
      currentCount++;
      maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, currentCount);
    } else {
      currentCount = 0;
    }
    index++;
  }
  return maxCount;

console.log(countChar("aaaaa", "a"));
test("first test", () => {
  expect(countChar("aaaaa", "a")).toBe(5);
