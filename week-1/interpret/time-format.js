// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?

// b) How many function calls are there?

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?

// f) Think about whether this function will work for all values of movieLength.
//    Think of what values may cause problems for the code.
//    Decide the result should be for those values, then test it out.
//    Can you find any values of movieLength which don't give you what you'd expect?
